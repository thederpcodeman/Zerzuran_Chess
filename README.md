A variant of Chess originally created in Zerzura as Anti-NWO propaganda (in a similar way to monopoly irl) but eventually morphed over years in the public domain. (I'm not an expert in Zerzuran law, so I'm assuming that if that either they don't have IP laws, they have a very short duration, or it's creator just allowed people to do whatever)
The game is somewhat popular in Zerzura, with some small pockets of popularity scattered across parts of atlas. There are many, many versions of it, this is the most popular version on the Zerzuran internet.
The game actually was originally called Zerzuran Chess. It's fairly obvious that its creator didn't actually know much about what actually happens on Earth.

(The above relates to a worldbuilding project called 'The World Beyond The Ice Wall' and is not actually true IRL to my knowledge.)


Rules:
Chess... but with randomly selected variant game rules, kept secret from both players. (you just have to figure out what's going on.)
On your turn, you move 1 of your pieces. (keep in mind you may have to make multiple moves in a row for one reason or another.)
If either player has no Royal pieces remaining, or only 1 piece remaining, they lose, and the other player wins.
Because I believe the game is better without it, you are allowed to move into check, and checkmate does not matter. (I will not allow accusations of this being the result of me being unable to program check and checkmate, I removed it on purpose and there are still remnants in the code. For instance moves that would put you in check are highlighted red, of course I could have had check and checkmate, I mean, someone else programmed this part, but still.)
