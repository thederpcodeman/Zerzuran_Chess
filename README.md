A chess variant originally called Chesscapades, currently it has been rethemed around a worlbuilding project called the world beyone the ice wall, but it is planned to be removed from that context soon for copywright reasons


Rules:
Chess... but with randomly selected variant game rules, kept secret from both players. (you just have to figure out what's going on.)
On your turn, you move 1 of your pieces. (keep in mind you may have to make multiple moves in a row for one reason or another.)
If either player has no Royal pieces remaining, or only 1 piece remaining, they lose, and the other player wins.
Because I believe the game is better without it, you are allowed to move into check, and checkmate does not matter. (I will not allow accusations of this being the result of me being unable to program check and checkmate, I removed it on purpose and there are still remnants in the code. For instance moves that would put you in check are highlighted red, of course I could have had check and checkmate, I mean, someone else programmed this part, but still.)


Controls:

click another square to move to that square (if legal)
