A variant of Chess originally created in Zerzura as Anti-NWO propaganda (in a similar way to monopoly irl) but eventually morphed over years in the public domain. (I'm not an expert in Zerzuran law, so I'm assuming that if that either they don't have IP laws, they have a very short duration, or it's creator just allowed people to do whatever)
The game is somewhat popular in Zerzura, with some small pockets of popularity scattered across parts of atlas. There are many, many versions of it, this is the most popular version on the Zerzuran internet.
The game actually was originally called Zerzuran Chess. It's fairly obvious that it's creator didn't actually know much about what actually happens on Earth.

(The above relates to a worldbuilding project called 'The World Beyond The Ice Wall' and is not actually true IRL to my knowledge.)
